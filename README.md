### Goals

The goals of this project were to highlight all the one star reviews on yelp, specifically for beautiful places. I personally find it hilarious when people have something negative to say about something amazing (the grand canyon for example). Unfortunately the yelp fusion API doesn't allow you to target a star amount, they only give you 3 randomly rated reviews for each establishment.
